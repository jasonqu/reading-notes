对 for 的性能不满的话，可以用spire cfor，基于macro的，性能等于while实现 https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/learning_spire_cfor.html

Pacific Northwest Scala 2013 We're Doing It All Wrong by Paul Phillips

发布日期：2013年10月25日
My conclusion after moving a million lines of code is that everything we do (plus or minus) is wrong. Henry Ford said "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Our horses are now a billion times faster: our horses may well be the fastest in the galaxy. Are we too comfortable on our horses? Would we recognize better mounts if they came along, but didn't look like horses? Is the state of our profession one which warrants pride, shame, or despair? I will explore these questions with unwarranted optimism.

Scala Collections: Why Not?

Paul Phillips is a co-founder of Typesafe and the most prolific committer to Scala. He's spent the last 5 years developing the language, writing a lot of code and drawing a lot of conclusions, but has decided to walk away. In this talk, he explains why.

He outlines what he believes to be certain shortcomings of the Scala collections library. In Paul's words, "Based on my extensive experience with Scala collections, I'm writing my own. The focus is much tighter: immutable, performant, predictable, correct. The talk will alternate between why the Scala collections manage none of those things, and how I hope to do better."

A day after the SF Scala event, Paul left this comment on their meetup page, which seems relevant, "[...] I already discovered that if I say nothing about it then people will draw very incorrect conclusions about what the major issues are and why I've moved on. It's not sad, it's not happy, it's only a question of whether you want the real picture or some distant reflection of it."
