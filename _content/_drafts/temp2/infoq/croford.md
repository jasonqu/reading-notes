Programming Style & Your Brain

Head.
Gut.
Two Systems.

Advertising. vs Tobacco.

Computer Programs.
The most complicated things
people make.

Perfection.

Programming uses
Head and Gut.
Tradeoffs.

Prefer forms that are error
resistant.

“That hardly ever happens”
is another way of saying
“It happens”.

A good style can help produce
better programs.
Style is should not be about
personal preference and selfexpression.

Medieval copyists introduced
lowercase, word breaks, and
punctuation.
These innovations helped reduce
the error rate.

Good use of style can help
reduce the occurrence of
errors.

The Elements of Style
William Strunk
http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html

Programs must communicate
clearly to people.

Use elements of good
composition where applicable.
For example, use a space after a
comma, not before.

Confusion must be avoided.

If there is a feature of a
language that is sometimes
problematic, and if it can be
replaced with another feature
that is more reliable, then
always use the more reliable
feature.

Avoid forms that are difficult to
distinguish from common
errors.

Make your programs look like
what they do.

Declare all variables at the top
of the function.
Declare all functions before
you call them.

Write in a way that clearly
communicates your intent.

As our processes become
more agile, our coding must
be more resilient.

For no cost, by adopting a
more rigorous style, many
classes of errors can be
automatically avoided.

Bad stylists
• Under educated.
• Old school.
• Thrill seeker.
• Exhibitionist.

Performance.
• Performance specific code is usually
crufty.
• Clean code is easier to reason about.
• Premature optimization is the root of all
evil. DONALD KNUTH
• Most of the code has a negligible impact
on performance. Only optimize the code
that is taking the time.
• Algorithm replacement is vastly more
effective than code fiddling.

Programming is the most
complicated thing that humans do.
Computer programs must be perfect.
Humans are not good at perfect.

Designing a programming
style demands discipline.
It is not selecting features
because they are liked, or pretty,
or familiar.

The Abyss

The JSLint style was driven by
the need to automatically
detect defects.
Forms that can hide defects are
considered defective.

There will be bugs.
Do what you can to move the
odds to your favor.

Good style is good for your
gut.

The Analytical Language of John Wilkins
Jorge Luis Borges
These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which
doctor Franz Kuhn attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopedia entitled The
Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge. In its remote pages it is written
that the animals are divided into
a. belonging to the Emperor
b. embalmed
c. trained
d. piglets
e. sirens
f. fabulous
g. stray dogs
h. included in this classification
i. trembling like crazy
j. innumerables
k. drawn with a very fine camelhair brush
l. et cetera
m. just broke the vase
n. from a distance look like flies

Syntax is the least important
aspect of programming language
design.

Fashion is the least important
aspect of clothing design.
